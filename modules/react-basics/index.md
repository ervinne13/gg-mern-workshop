# React Basics

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

Learning about [atomic design](/modules/atomic-design.md) would really help you adjust more to the "React mentality"

We'll learn first about react in a "practical way" by doing an actual application while we learn, then we'll go back and revisit all the necessary concepts to learn them in depth.

Before getting our feet wet though, let's first discuss about React's weird syntax called `JSX`.

## Creating a React Application using CRA

If you havent installed CRA (create react app) yet, install it with:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Create a project we can test on with the command:

```bash
npx create-react-app scratch
```

Tip: we use `npx` not `npm`. Think of `npx` as something similar to `npm run`, it's used to run some package that is usually installed globally.

We'll call the application `scratch` as in kinda like a scratch paper.

Let's first learn about what happened and discuss about the structure - [click here](/modules/react-basics/cra-structure.md).

See your project in action in the URL specified in your terminal. For example: `Local: http://localhost:3001` or `On Your Network:  http://192.168.0.186:3001/`.
