# NoSQL Database Storage & Options

After this workshop, the attendees are expected to be able to use their knowledge to develop their own portfolios. This means applications that can be run online with the option of hosting it yourselves, or publishing it in a static page service (like github.io). Publishing it a static page services would mean that the application would have to connect to the database directly instead of having a backend do the connection, in short, it would be less secure.

## Serverless Architecture

A __serverless architecture__ is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. Oversimplifying it, it just means your application still has a server, it's just that you don't have to set it up your self.
