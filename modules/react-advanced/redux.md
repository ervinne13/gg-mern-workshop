# Implementing Redux

Redux is a way for you to manage your state. It boasts of its unidirectional data flow structure. This means that your data will only flow on one direction instead of 2 or more, making things more manageable for you.

A redux store is what we can call a "single source of truth". Think of it as a big json data storage where you reference everything from there instead of in different places.

## Redux vs Flux

Redux is based on the Flux data flow. Both have unidirectional data flow but keep in mind that these two are different.
